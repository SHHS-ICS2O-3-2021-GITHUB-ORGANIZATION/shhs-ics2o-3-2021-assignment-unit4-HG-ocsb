# VARIABLE DEFINITION
# INPUT
print ('please enter firstnumber')
firstnumber = int(input())
print ('please enter secondnumber')
secondnumber = int(input())
print ('please enter thirdnumber')
thirdnumber = int(input())
print ('please enter fourthnumber')
fourthnumber = int(input())
print ('please enter fithnumber')
fithnumber = int(input())
# PROCESSING
sum = (firstnumber + secondnumber + thirdnumber + fourthnumber + fithnumber)
average = ((firstnumber + secondnumber + thirdnumber + fourthnumber + fithnumber)/5)
# OUTPUT
#calculate sum
print (firstnumber + secondnumber + thirdnumber + fourthnumber + fithnumber)
#cal average
print ((firstnumber + secondnumber + thirdnumber + fourthnumber + fithnumber)/5)
